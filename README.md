# could-chuck-game
A simple matching game with a kicking twist! How well do you know Chuck Norris? Test your knowledge here. "Could Chuck" presents the user with options and asks them to choose one, then it asks if the user thinks their choice was something Chuck Norris actually did or not.

Users will start the game with twenty five points. If the user guesses corrrectly they will gain five points if not they will lose five points until the reach fifty  (and win) or zero (and lose).

On the page where the user guesses true or false they will be presented with a quote/joke from the chuck norris api at random.
